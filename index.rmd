## Leaflet map

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
Please zoom out to step back and see the marker. It should be pointing on Rio.
Though the centering I ,ade works perfectly in local, it does not work when it is hosted.

``` {r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
require(leaflet)
require(dplyr)
df <- data.frame(lat = -22.9553086, lng = -43.1910758)

map <- df  %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(popup = 'My place') %>% setView(lat = -22.9553086, lng = -43.1910758,zoom = 15)

map
```
